# REA UI CHALLENGE

### Description  

Display the list of properties using the data set within the "results" array running down the page in a column that has a heading labeled Results. There will be a second column with a heading Saved Properties, along side the Results column. It will contain the initial property within the "saved" array
Hovering over a property card in the Results column will display an 'add' button. Clicking the "add" button will create the property in the Saved Properties column. Hovering over a property card in the Saved Properties column will display a 'remove' button. Clicking the 'remove' button will remove the property from the list of saved properties.

The Solution to the challenge is implented in the React - Redux environment.

> node server.js 
```

The application would be running on [Port 3004](http://localhost:3004)

#### Testing the Project 

Navigate to the root folder and run the command 

```
> npm run test 
```

The following test cases have been included :

```

> Checking the number of saved property cards 
rendered against the mock up Saved json data. 
> Simulating the addition of property to the Saved Property by hovering over the Result Property card and clicking on the 'Add Property' Button. 
> Simulating the removal of property from the Saved Property by hovering over the Saved Property card and clicking on the 'Remove Property' Button. 
```
